# inventory-control-system
In a conventional system, the manager and staff needs to spend a lot of time calculating
and keeping track of sold items, making proper order to the vendors for restocking the
inventory. Those work hours are costly. Its waste of human resources in some trivial
works. Also Humans are prone to errors and even silly errors like miswriting can be
difficult to figure out and resolve. This system can automate most of this trivial work
which would be a great help for managers and staff. It will remove the room for error
and remove the issues caused by human error. As a result, it will save valuable time,
human resources and give an easy and errorless workflow.

This project aims to implement an inventory management system for restaurant
services. Inventory managers face two basic decisions such as: <br>
i) How much additional inventory to order/produce? <br>
ii) When to order/produce?
Restaurant inventory control system is a bit complex from other inventory management
systems for its nature. Each food item is made with many different ingredients, that
makes it more complex to keep track. Also things like local big events, certain times like
holidays and weekends or the climate changing demand for different foods all of this
affects the threshold level for each inventory item. All this makes these basic decisions
more difficult. Restaurant manager and staff had to keep track of all inventory the old
fashioned way. They have to count the end of every day how much they used and how
much inventory items left. Based on that they also need to decide how much more stock
they need. Also they need to prepare order documents to send it to the vendors for
restocking necessary items.
All of this results in waste of valuable human resources and valuable time. In this
project, we propose a software solution to automate all of this tedious work to be done
in real time. This software will keep track of inventory in real time. Each item will be
linked to its associative resource, as they sell each item it will calculate and update the
amount of ingredient or inventory item is left. All of the inventory status will be stored in
a backend database which is on cloud. Utilizing this database, the software will monitor
the threshold level for each inventory. If it reaches inventory threshold level it will not
only notify the user but also prepare a dynamic ordering form for restocking the
inventory. This form can be sent to vendors to order necessary inventory items upfront.
